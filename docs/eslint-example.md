# Example: Generating a benchmark report for `eslint`

This example shows you how to:

- Install the [`eslint`](https://eslint.org/) analysis tool.
- Configure the driver for `eslint`.
- Run `eslint` on the source code of selected CVEs using `bin/cli run`.
- View a benchmark report for the analysis run using `bin/cli report`.

### Prerequisites 

Before working through this example, you must install
the CVE Benchmark tooling. For more information, see 
[Using the CVE Benchmark](../README.md#step-1-install-the-tooling-and-metadata).

### Installing `eslint`

You must install each analysis tool that you want to benchmark with `bin/cli run`.
Some drivers are provided with installer scripts that install their backing analysis tool, 
while other drivers require manual installation steps. When adding support for a new
analysis tool, we encourage you to provide an installer.

To see which tools are available, and which have installers, 
run `bin/cli tools`:

```
$ bin/cli tools
Configured tools in /home/user-name/ossf-cve-benchmarking/config.json:
...

Available driver installers:
- ...
- contrib/tools/eslint/installers/install.cmd
- contrib/tools/eslint/installers/install.sh
- ...

Available driver READMEs:
- ...
- contrib/tools/eslint/README.md
- ...

Configured:
...
```

The output shows that `eslint` is available with an installer. 
Run the installer, specifying a directory to install `eslint` in: 

```
$ contrib/tools/eslint/installers/install.sh /home/user-name/analysis-tools/eslint-2020-12-08
The eslint tool has been installed. Add the fragment below to a config.json file:

{
  ...
  "tools": {
    ...
    "eslint-default": {
      "bin": "node",
      "args": [
        "/home/user-name/ossf-cve-benchmark/build/ts/contrib/tools/eslint/src/eslint.js",
      ],
      "options": {
        "eslintDir": "/home/user-name/analysis-tools/eslint-2020-12-08"
      }
    }
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```

`eslint` has now been successfully installed. 
`bin/cli` does not interact directly with `eslint`, but rather through 
a driver that executes `eslint` on selected code and converts the results
to a form that benchmark reports can be generated from. So, to complete the setup, 
you must also configure the driver. 

### Configuring the driver for `eslint`

To configure the driver for an analysis tool, you need to add
a `tools` entry to your local 
[`config.json` file](configuration.md#configuration-file-options-for-bincli).

For `eslint`, the installer script displays the appropriate
snippet at the end of its output: 

```
{
  "tools": {
    "eslint-default": {
        "bin": "node",
        "args": [
            "/home/user-name/ossf-cve-benchmark/build/ts/contrib/tools/eslint/src/eslint.js",
        ]
        
    }
    "options": {
      "eslintDir": "/home/user-name/analysis-tools/eslint-2020-12-08"
    }
  }
}
```

This snippet includes the identifier `eslint-default` that you need 
to specify with the `--tool` option on the command line.
After updating your `config.json` file with this snippet, check 
that `eslint` has been successfully
configured by running `bin/cli tools` again:

```
$ bin/cli tools
Configured:
- eslint-default
...
```

The identifier `eslint-default` is now listed as configured 
for use with `bin/cli`. 

### Running `eslint`

After completing the steps above, you can use 
`bin/cli run` to run an analysis with `eslint` over 
one or more benchmark CVEs. In this example we'll select two CVEs, 
CVE-2018-16492 and CVE-2020-4066. 

To run the analysis with `eslint`, you must specify the name of 
the identifier used in your `config.json` file, `eslint-default`,
with the `--tool` option:

```
$ bin/cli run --tool eslint-default CVE-2018-16492 CVE-2020-4066
...
```

For more information about specifying data to analyze with your tool,
see [Selecting CVEs of interest](configuration.md#selecting-cves-of-interest). 

After running the command, results files are generated in
JSON format. By default, the files are written to disk 
in `work/results/eslint-default_....json`.

### Creating reports for the runs

Now that you have data for some runs, you can 
view a benchmark report using the `bin/cli report` command.

To start a report server that you can view in your browser, 
run the following:

```
$ bin/cli report --kind server --tool eslint-default CVE-2018-16492 CVE-2020-4066
```
Navigate to http://localhost:8080 in your browser to view
the report.
