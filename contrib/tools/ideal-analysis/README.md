# contrib/tools/ideal-analysis

This directory contains the trivial driver for the ideal analysis that
simply reports all of the known weaknesses.  The results from this
driver are useful as tests and for seeing how far realistic analysis
tools are from the ideal results.

## Installation

This driver does not require any installation steps, the install
scripts will simply display the required configuration, see
[installers/install.sh](./installers/install.sh).

## Configuration

To make use of this driver, add a tools entry in the config file 
as instructed by the install script above. 

```json
{
    ...
    "tools": {
        ...

        "ideal-analysis": {
            "bin": "node",
            "args": [
                "/home/user-name/ossf-cve-benchmark/build/ts/contrib/tools/ideal-analysis/src/ideal-analysis.js"
            ]
        }

        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

This will allow you to use the tool-id `ideal-analysis` in `cli/bin run
--tool ideal-analysis -`.
