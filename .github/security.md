Thank you for improving the security of `ossf-cve-benchmark`. We appreciate your efforts and

a collaboration on a [Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-github-security-advisories).

The lead maintainer will acknowledge your issue within 48 hours, and
